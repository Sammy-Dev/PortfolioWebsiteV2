## Summary
This is the second and incarnation of my personal developer portfolio.\
I find that fancy and complex UI designs can be interesting, however when well executed a clean and minimal UI often offers a more enjoyable experience for the user. This is the core philosophy behind the design of this website.  

## Technical details
For the initial mock-ups and design prototypes I used **Figma**.\
The website itself is written in React and vanilla CSS.\
For website hosting I used **GitHub Pages** with a custom domain name.

## Challenges 
To make this website fully responsive a lot of tweaking was required in order to get the UI design exactly as I wanted for all different screen dimensions (as is pretty standard with most front end web development)

Once the website was initially deployed onto Github Pages, I ran into an issue with React client-side routing. The website would throw a 404 error if you refresh the page or try to search an exact page URL. After some research I found [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) which allowed me to resolve this issue and the website now functions as intended.

## Summary
This is the second and updated version of my personal developer portfolio.\
I find that websites using complex designs can be interesting, however when well executed, a clean and minimal website often offers a more enjoyable experience for the user. This is the core philosophy I had when designing and creating this website. 

## Technical details
For the initial idea mock-ups and design prototypes I used **Figma**.\
For development of the website I used the **React** JavaScript framework inside of Visual Studio Code IDE.\
For hosting the website, I used **GitHub Pages** with a custom domain name.

## Biggest challenges 
As is standard a lot of tweaking and experimenting was required in order to get the page design exactly as I wanted for all different screen dimensions as website is intended to be fully responsive. \

once the website was initially deployed, I ran into an issue with reacts client-side routing. The issue was the website would throw 404 errors if you refresh and page or try to search an exact page URL even if the page exists. After a lot of testing and research I found itâ€™s a pretty common problem with multiple different approaches to solve. I found [this GitHub repo] (https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) which provides a good solution that fit my use case well.

## Summary
This is the second and updated version of my personal developer portfolio.\
I find that websites using complex designs can be interesting, however when well executed, a clean and minimal website often offers a more enjoyable experience for the user. This is the core philosophy I had when designing and creating this website. 

## Technical details
For the initial idea mock-ups and design prototypes I used **Figma**.\
The website itself is written in React and vanilla CSS.\
For website hosting I used **GitHub Pages** with a custom domin name.

## Challenges 
As is standard with front end development, a lot of tweaking was required in order to get the page design exactly as I wanted for all different screen dimensions as the website is intended to be fully responsive. 

Once the website was initially deployed, I ran into an issue with React client-side routing. The issue was the website would throw a 404 error if you refresh any page or try to search an exact page URL even if the page exists. After some research I found [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) which provides a good solution that fit my use case well.
